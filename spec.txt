My modified Pluralcode based on plural.codes:

# == Placeholders

N#		- number of headmates
D#		- on a scale 1..10 to what degree do you feel you have discovered all the headmates in your system?
C#		- on a scale 1..10 how well do you and your headmates communicate with each other?
Q#		- on a scale 1..10 how much amnesia is there between you and your headmates? (1 = remember everything, 10 = remember nothing)
W#		- on a scale 1..10 how how open are you about your pluraliy (1 = closeted, 10 = completely open)
